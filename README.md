# Deep_Learning_Image_Recognition
A basic convolutional neural network written in python using the Keras library.

I would like to recognize the following sources for helping me develope this code:
- Udemy course: Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks.
- The posts by Apostolos and Tuatini in this udemy comments section, this helped me greatly in optimizing the architecture of the CNN; https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/learn/v4/questions/2276518 .
